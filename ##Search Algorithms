##Search Algorithms 
The program will run BFS, DFS and UCS algorithms on the given input (for the purposes of the assignment this is the egypt map). The Program reads in and parses the formatted data and builds a SearchGraph filled with nodes. Each node has has a list of successors which it references during expansion. Distances (costs) are recorded with these successors. The actual implementations are simply queueing variations on the general search function included in main. DFS queues at the front, BFS at the back and UCS queues arbitrarily and reorders every time (PQ). The Searcher class holds both the queue and the solution list along with all necessary utility functions for operations on these. 

##Use
###Code
Just uncomment the correct lines (37-39)
<pre>
	sq.queueDFS(next.expand());
	sq.queueBFS(next.expand());
	sq.queueUCS(next, next.expand());
</pre>
inside the general search function. The result is a print of all visited nodes in the order in which they were visited.
###Compilation/Run
The project has been exported to a .jar with all relevant files included. Simply navigate to the file in which the project is saved and <pre>java -jar search.jar</pre> to run the project (default is DFS) change the commented lines to use different solutions.
